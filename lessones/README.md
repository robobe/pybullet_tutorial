# PyBullet lessens
PyBullet is the Python interface to the Bullet Physics Engine, a real-time rigid-body physics simulator.

It provides:

- Rigid body dynamics
- Joints (revolute, prismatic, fixed, etc.)
- Collision detection
- Basic sensors
- Real-time and stepped simulation
- CPU-based physics (fast, lightweight)

It is widely used for:

- Robotics research
- Reinforcement learning
- Control prototyping
- Physics-based testing
